## Sales Encouraging C2C Marketplace

Many have their closets stuffed with plenty of things they don’t need. Perhaps they could sell at least some of them via an online exchange platform but they doubt any of those may be needed and don’t want to waste their time trying.

### Goals

Our idea is a marketplace that creates incentives for people to sell goods they no longer need. We are going to achieve it by implementing the following two ideas that could be a part of an exchange marketplace:

1. Allow buyers to add the products they are looking for, set the prices they are ready to pay, and set the date when they would need those things. This will allow potential sellers to see there is a demand for something they may have and may be willing to get rid of. It will also include a matching algorithm to help sellers and buyers find each other.

2. Allow sellers to get their 'closet sales' potential score quickly. With a mobile application that uses image recognition a seller could point his phone camera at various goods getting dusty on his/her shelves and immediately receive information about the demand for those goods and for how much they could be sold.

### Technologies

PHP or NodeJS to implement the server side of the application including the mobile app API, TensorFlow or similar for image recognition.
